# NLP-and-Sentiment-Analysis

##  Project Overview
-  This project focuses on the application of traditional machine learning techniques to perform sentiment analysis on customer reviews. Sentiment analysis is a critical component of Natural Language Processing (NLP) that deals with understanding and classifying emotions expressed in text data. Our approach involves preprocessing text data, applying feature engineering techniques, and utilizing various machine learning algorithms for classification.

##  Key Features
-  Data Exploration: Analysis of the distribution of sentiments (positive, neutral, negative) in the dataset.
-  Text Preprocessing: Includes cleaning and transforming text data into a suitable format for machine learning.
-  Feature Engineering: Utilization of Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) for converting text data into a numerical format.
-  Class Imbalance Handling: Application of ADASYN (Adaptive Synthetic Sampling) to address class imbalances in the dataset.
-  Model Training and Evaluation: Training of Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Naive Bayes models, followed by a comprehensive evaluation based on accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices.

##  Technologies Used
-  Python
-  Libraries: pandas, scikit-learn, NLTK, seaborn, matplotlib

##  Usage
Run the Jupyter notebooks to follow the steps of data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. The notebooks are self-explanatory and contain all the necessary instructions and explanations.

##  Contributing
-  Contributions to this project are welcome.
